# README: Language Modeling

## Overview
This project explores language modeling techniques using deep learning. The `Language_Modeling.ipynb` notebook demonstrates key concepts such as tokenization, model training, and text generation.

## Features
- Preprocessing of textual data for language modeling.
- Implementation of neural network-based language models.
- Tokenization and sequence encoding for text input.
- Training and fine-tuning of a language model.
- Generating text based on trained models.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** for deep learning models.
- **Transformers** library for NLP tasks.
- **Hugging Face Models** for pre-trained architectures.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch transformers jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Language_Modeling.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to process text, train models, and generate text.
3. Modify hyperparameters or datasets to experiment with different results.

## Future Enhancements
- Experiment with different model architectures.
- Use larger datasets for better model training.
- Implement fine-tuning on specific domain-based corpora.
- Optimize model efficiency for real-time applications.
